## üññ Greetings!

My name is Leehyon, you can also call me Koh, a mechanical engineering master's degree holder turned embedded software engineer.

I completed my studies at KIT in Germany and I am currently working in the automotive industry in Shanghai. I have a foundation in programming languages such as C/C++ and C#, which I utilize in my work.

Beyond academics and my professional life, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities and constantly expanding my knowledge in various domains. I find great value in maintaining a reflective mindset, constantly questioning and exploring the underlying principles of different subjects to broaden my perspectives and discover new possibilities.

## üèïÔ∏è About Kohsruhe

[Kohsruhe](https://www.kohsruhe.com) is my first website, built using Hugo and hosted on GitHub.

The name of the site is a combination of my nickname "Koh", and the German word "Ruhe", meaning "peace" or "calm". I hope that through this site I can settle my thoughts and find a sense of inner peace. Well, no quatsch, the name is largely borrowed from "Karlsruhe", the city where I studied in Germany, hahaha.

The site content is rather messy, it may involve industry technology, life experiences and so on. But I will try to keep it simple, clear, focused and detailed. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement or would like to discuss something further, please don't hesitate to [contact](mailto:leehyon@live.com) me.
