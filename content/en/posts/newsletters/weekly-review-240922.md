## Foreword

This article is a record and reflection on life from 2024-09-17 to 2024-09-22.

This week, I only worked for three days, but due to project requirements, I worked from home on Saturday. I began to understand that "the world is a huge make-do setup", not thinking deeply and being superficial is probably the norm. The weather is finally not so hot; autumn should be coming. Tossed around with Mastodon and am ready to play around in the Fediverse.

## The world is a huge make-do setup?

I wonder if everyone has had similar experiences or thoughts at work? Actually, this joke has been around for a long time, but some recent work events have made me feel more and more that the "make-do setup" might not be a fantasy; it may be right beside us.

> The make-do setup theory suggests that people find that the world does not operate as precisely as we perceive it, but is full of chaos and superficiality everywhere. Various organizations look glamorous on the surface, but each has its own issues.

Of course, most of the time, I am also make-do, so we are all in the same boat. I don't think it's meaningful to judge this phenomenon now, because it is indeed the norm and difficult to avoid. Think about our work, isn't it often like this:

1. The team may have been quickly assembled due to a temporary project or emergency, without enough time for thorough planning and preparation.
2. Team members may not match in skills, experience, or work styles, and cannot collaborate effectively.
3. Communication between team members is insufficient, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts.

As discussed in the last issue about chaos, isn't this another manifestation of it? Entropy increase is the truth, but more importantly, "after recognizing the truth of life, still love life":

- Many seemingly professional things are actually just superficial appearances, others are the same, so boldly try, as long as you research deeply, you will find opportunities.
- Maintain curiosity about the field and skepticism about professionalism. Professionalism can isolate criticism and reinforce social hierarchy, encourage openness through questioning and personal sensitivity.
- Invest trust and time in yourself, respect autonomy, while still interacting with society, not just following the societal definitions. What if it's a make-do setup? I have my own definition.

Perhaps we can be like Truman, continuously picking up the true fragments of the world along the way, and then stepping through that door to say:

> Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!

## Mastodon

This week I started posting things on Mastodon and integrated it into the "Toots" sub-column of the blog. The experience so far has been good, and I will keep it updated.

Actually, I registered on Mastodon last year, but didn't play much with it. This week, I revisited the Fediverse and found it quite interesting.

Currently, I will post some daily life on Mastodon, which will be quite trivial, and I will also record some thoughts or share information and links that I find valuable. Friends who are interested are welcome to join. You can find me on [ohai.social](https://ohai.social/) at [@leehyon@ohai.social](https://ohai.social/@leehyon).

## Inescapable daily record

This section will record some progress on personal projects this week, as well as books and media I have read or listened to, and some interesting things I bought, so the content will be quite journal-like.
